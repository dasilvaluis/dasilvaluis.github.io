# Luís Silva | Full-Stack Developer

Graduated from computer science and informatics where I experienced many technologies, and mostly self-taught in the field of web development where I apply my academic knowledge, industry good practices and creativity.

I first got into the field through small projects and an internship; started to work afterwards as a developer for digital and creative agencies, while doing a bit of freelance work.

With about 3 years of experience, I’ve been working from front-end to back-end development including, landing pages, custom Wordpress themes and plugins, REST API's, etc.

Being a supporter of open source technologies, I contributed to a couple of public projects and published some personal ones on Githug (https://github.com/luism-s).
