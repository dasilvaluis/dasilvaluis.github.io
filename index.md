# Luís Silva | Full-Stack Developer
Graduated from computer science and informatics where I experienced many technologies, and mostly self-taught in the field of web development, where I apply my academic knowledge, industry good practices and creativity.

With about 3 years of experience, I’ve been working from front-end to back-end development, landing pages, custom Wordpress themes and plugins, REST API's, etc.

Being a supporter of open source technologies, I contribute to public projects and published some personal ones on [Github](https://github.com/luism-s){:target='_blank'}.
